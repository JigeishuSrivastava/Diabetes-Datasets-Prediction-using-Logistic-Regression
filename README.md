# Diabetes-Datasets-Prediction-using-Logistic-Regression

#Overview:

This project utilizes logistic regression to predict diabetes based on various health metrics. The dataset contains information about patients, including features such as glucose levels, blood pressure, and body mass index (BMI). The goal is to accurately classify individuals as diabetic or non-diabetic.

#Introduction:

Diabetes is a chronic condition that can lead to serious health complications if not managed properly. Early prediction and diagnosis are crucial for effective management. This project demonstrates how to leverage logistic regression to identify individuals at risk of diabetes, helping healthcare professionals make informed decisions.

#Dataset:

The dataset used in this project is sourced from the Pima Indians Diabetes Database, which is publicly available. It contains the following features:

Pregnancies: Number of pregnancies
Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration
BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function
Age: Age (years)
Outcome: Class variable (0 or 1) indicating if the patient has diabetes

#Technologies Used:

Python
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-Learn
Matplotlib
Jupyter Notebook

#Usage:

Load the dataset and explore it using Jupyter Notebook.
Preprocess the data (handle missing values, feature scaling, etc.).
Split the data into training and testing sets.
Train the logistic regression model.
Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.
Visualize the results.


#Results:

The logistic regression model achieved an accuracy of approximately XX% on the test set. Additional metrics (precision, recall, F1-score) are also provided in the notebook for a comprehensive evaluation.
